In modern computing, this software is split into two categories: operating system kernels and processes.
When Linux starts up, it launches an init (short for initializer) process that, in turn, launches a bunch of other processes which launch more processes until, eventually,
we are looking at the command line shell, which is also a process!
The shell, of course, launches processes in response to the commands we enter.
